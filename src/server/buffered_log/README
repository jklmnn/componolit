This components sits inbetween a log client and a log server. It offers a LOG
session immediately after start, even before the upstream log session could be
created.

The rational is devices where no log session can be provided by core (VGA) or
some basic driver (serial). In these cases it makes sense to provided a log
session through a more complex scenario, e.g. using network logging or a
framebuffer terminal. To enable components required to provided this setup to
log output, buffered_log saves log messages until after its log session became
available.
